## Mods

These mods work with [ModLoader](https://github.com/BrotatoMods/Brotato-ModLoader).

Mods with a cross (‚ùå) haven't been updated to work with the latest version of ModLoader yet.

To download a mod, visit its repo page (the main link on the left), then click Releases in the left sidebar. The mod ZIP is shown in the "Assets" section of each release.
