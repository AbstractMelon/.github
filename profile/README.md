This organisation collects multiple Brotato modding repos together, in one easy place.

Mod creators can join this org to move or create repos here. They'll be attributed to [BrotatoMods](https://github.com/BrotatoMods) but otherwise behave like any other repo, eg. you can still pin repos in this org to your profile. To join, reach out to Darkly77 (`Darkly77#0316`) on the [Space Potatoes Discord](https://discord.gg/j39jE6k).
